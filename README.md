# A Cancel Culture Corpus through the lens of Natural Language Processing

This repository contains the Cancel Culture Corpus from the associated [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lateraisse-1.3) by [Justus-Jonas Erker](https://erker.ai), [Catalina Goanta](https://www.uu.nl/staff/ECGoanta) and [Jerry Spanakis](https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/jerry.spanakis/).

## Abstract
Cancel Culture as an Internet phenomenon has been previously explored from a social and legal science perspective. This paper demonstrates how Natural Language Processing tasks can be derived from this previous work, underlying techniques on how cancel culture can be measured, identified and evaluated. As part of this paper, we introduce a first cancel culture data set with of over 2.3 million tweets and a framework to enlarge it further. We provide a detailed analysis of this data set and propose a set of features, based on various models including sentiment analysis and emotion detection that can help characterizing cancel culture.
